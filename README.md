I will not guarantee that the build in refactoring branch is functioning. There will sometimes also be errors while I work on making the biggest changes.

Other than that, feel free to yoink the code. Whether your project is commercial or non-comemrcial, you can do whatever you want with it. Any other assets (art, music) that have been made for this game demo are mine, and can't be used in any way, shape or form.
